												The Customer who assumes the
												function of the skipper must
												have the competence and
												skills required to navigate
												the vessel safely, along
												with a license for open sea
												sailing and a GMDSS Radio
												Operator's License. If the
												Client does not possess the
												required competence, skills
												and licenses for navigating
												the vessel, he/she warrants
												that the vessel is operated
												by the member of his crew,
												who has such qualification.
												The Service Provider
												reserves the right to ask
												the Customer or the
												appointed skipper of the
												vessel to demonstrate
												his/her competence and
												skills at sea, in the
												presence of the its
												representative. The time
												required for the

												Customer does not have
												sufficient competence,
												experience and/or a valid
												license for navigation, the
												Service Provider will
												provide the crew with an
												official skipper at an extra
												cost. If the Customer
												refuses to accept the
												appointed skipper, the
												Service Provider reserves
												the right to prohibit
												departure of the vessel,
												cancel the trip and to
												retain the full paid amount.
												In these circumstances, any
												amounts paid will not be
												refunded. If the Customer
												knows in advance that a
												skippered vessel will be
												required, he/she must inform
												the Service Provider at the
												time of the booking. The
												security deposit is required
												when chartering a vessel

												The vessel carries third
												party damage and liability
												insurance (compulsory
												insurance). Comprehensive
												insurance for the vessel is
												provided in the amount of
												the vessel’s value as it is
												recorded in the insurance
												policy. The comprehensive
												insurance covers damage
												above the amount of the
												security deposit, but not
												the damages caused
												intentionally or by
												negligence. The Service
												Provider shall have no
												liability for loss or damage
												to personal effects of the
												Customer, or other
												passengers and crew members,
												nor is Service Provider
												responsible for any personal
												effects of third parties
												left on board, the company
												vehicle, or within the
												offices of a Service
												Provider. Upon making the
												advance payment and
												accepting the Terms And
												Condition, the Customer
												waives all damage claims
												towards the Service Provider
												for loss or damage to
												personal or third party
												effects. In the event of
												loss or damage, the Service
												Provider must be notified
												immediately. In the event of
												a more serious incident, or
												the participation of more
												than one vessel, the Client
												shall notify the competent
												Harbour Master's Office, and
												request the necessary
												documents for the insurers.
												In case the damages covered
												by the insurance policy are
												not immediately reported to
												the Service Provider,
												competent bodies and the
												insurance providers, or in
												case the necessary
												documentation has not been
												submitted on time, they
												would not be acknowledged in
												accordance with the terms of
												insurance and and would need
												to be covered by the
												Customer. In case of damage
												to the vessel covered by the
												insurance policy, Customer
												is obliged to cover all
												costs in accordance with the
												existing comprehensive
												insurance conditions only up
												to the amount of a security
												deposit. Customer is liable
												for the cost of all damages
												to the vessel and/or
												equipment caused by him/her
												or his/her party’s
												negligence or misuse and/or
												loss of one or more parts of
												the equipment.
											</li>
											<li>
												The sails are not insured.
												The Customer is liable for
												any cost incurred for damage
												to the sails. The Customer
												shall have no liability for
												reasonable wear and tear of
												sails and for any damage to
												the sails caused by breaking
												of the mast. The deposit
												insurance policy does not
												include damage to the sails,
												damages to or loss of
												inflatable boat and outboard
												engine(s).
											</li>
											<li>
												The Customer is financially
												liable for any defect or
												damage to the vessel that
												occurs during the charter
												period and that is not
												related to the vessel’s
												depreciation. Before making
												any repairs or purchases,
												the Customer will contact
												the Service Provider and
												reach an agreement on the
												technical feasibility of the
												repair and the manner of
												payment. The Service
												Provider is financially
												liable for any loss or
												damage that occurs during
												the charter period and which
												is caused by reasonable wear
												and tear of the vessel and
												its equipment. The Customer
												must obtain the approval of
												the Service Provider prior
												to initiating any repairs in
												order to agree on the
												technical and financial
												aspects of the repair. The
												Customer will pay for the
												repairs on site and keep the
												invoices in order to be
												refunded in full upon return
												to the base.
											</li>
											<li>
												The Customer will
												immediately notify the
												Service Provider of any
												defects or damage regardless
												of their cause. If the base
												of the Service Provider is
												not able to arrive and
												immediately eliminate the
												damages occurred, the
												Service Provider will
												personally eliminate those
												damages, or instruct the
												Customer to engage the third
												party to eliminate the
												damages occurred. Prior to
												the repair of the damage by
												the third party, the Service
												Provider must certify the
												manner of execution of
												repair and its cost. After
												the Service Provider
												approves the agreed cost and
												the manner of execution of
												the repair, the Customer is
												authorized to settle the
												cost of the repair on behalf
												of the Service Provider. The
												Customer is required to keep
												the paid invoice. In the
												event of any damage or
												failure due to the age or
												deterioration of the vessel,
												the Service Provider is
												obliged to refund the amount
												paid to the Customer. Any
												unauthorized repairs or
												changes to the gear and
												equipment will be charged to
												the Customer.
